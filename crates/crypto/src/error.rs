//! Error type for sealing/opening secrets.

//! Variants are intentionally coarse and carry **no** plaintext, key bytes, or cryptographic
//! detail — an attacker must not learn *why* a decryption failed (e.g. wrong key vs. tampered
//! ciphertext vs. wrong context), only that it did. This avoids padding/MAC oracle style leaks.
