# API reference

The machine-readable contract is **[openapi.yaml](openapi.yaml)**, and it is enforced: the
`drift_tests` integration test validates live responses against that spec, so the two cannot
silently diverge. This page is the human-readable tour.

All responses use a consistent envelope — **including errors**, where `data` is `null`:

```json
{ "statusCode": 200, "message": "OK", "data": { } }
```

## Authentication

Two credential types, with deliberately different power:

| Credential | Header | Can do |
|---|---|---|
| **Dashboard JWT** | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Everything: create wallets, provision a gas tank, read the key backup |
| **Wallet API key** | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Per-wallet operations only. **Cannot** provision a gas tank or read a backup |

Neither can move funds — see below. Tokens carry a unique `jti`; `logout` and `refresh` both
deny-list the presented token, and every authenticated request checks that deny-list.

- `POST /v1/auth/signup` — create an account, returns a JWT.
- `POST /v1/auth/login` — returns a JWT.
- `POST /v1/auth/refresh` — issue a new token **and revoke the presented one**.
- `POST /v1/auth/logout` — revoke the presented token (a second logout is `401`, not `200`).
- `GET  /v1/auth/me` — the current user.

## Custody model — read this before the wallet endpoints

octo is **non-custodial**. The wallet's private key is generated and held **client-side**; the
server stores only the public account and an opaque, client-encrypted backup blob it cannot
decrypt. Consequently:

- There is **no endpoint that signs a payment for you.** You build and sign locally, then relay.
- `POST /v1/wallets/:id/withdraw` and `POST /v1/wallets/:id/trustlines` are **`410 Gone`
  tombstones**. They exist only to give integrators a clear error pointing at `submit-signed`.

## Wallets

- `POST /v1/wallets` — register a wallet from a **client-generated** keypair.
  Body: `{ "public_key": "G...", "encrypted_backup"?: string, "label"?: string,
  "description"?: string }`. `public_key` is required; a body without it is `400`.
  Returns `201` with `{ id, network, address, custody, funded }`.
  **Never returns a mnemonic** — the client generated it and the server never saw it.
- `GET  /v1/wallets` — list your wallets (paginated).
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}` — wallet details.
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/balances` — live on-chain balances. Fetched synchronously from
  Horizon under a **10 s** route timeout (independent of per-attempt retries); if Horizon is
  slower than that, the request ends with `504` in the standard envelope — safe to retry.
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/transactions` — deposits + outbound transfers (paginated).
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/backup` — the opaque client-encrypted backup blob, for new-device
  recovery. **Dashboard JWT only.** Useless without the user's password.

## Moving funds (the non-custodial path)

1. `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/signing-info` — returns the account `sequence`, the network
   passphrase, and the base fee, so you can build a transaction without talking to Horizon.
2. Build and **sign locally**.
3. `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/submit-signed` — body `{ "transaction_xdr": "<base64>" }`.
   The server validates (v1 envelope, at least one signature, source account == this wallet,
   operation-type allowlist) and relays it **unmodified**. On failure it returns Horizon's
   result codes (`tx_bad_seq`, `op_no_trust`, …) so you can correct and re-sign.

## Addresses

- `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/addresses` — generate a dedicated customer address.
  Returns `muxed_address` (`M...`) **and** the `{ base_address, memo_id }` fallback.
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/addresses` — list addresses (paginated).

## Gas sponsorship

Lets you pay your users' Stellar fees. The **gas tank** is a separate, server-held account that
carries fee float only — the one server-held key in the system, bounded by your gas budget.

- `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/gas-tank` — provision the gas tank. **Dashboard JWT only** (an API key
  gets `401`). Idempotent: a second call returns the existing tank.
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/sponsorship` / `PUT` — read/update `enabled`, the per-transaction fee
  cap, and the daily budget.
  - `daily_budget_stroops`: `null`/omitted = **unlimited**; `0` = sponsorship **fully disabled**
    for the day (every sponsor request gets `429`); negative → `400`.
  - `per_tx_fee_cap_stroops`: `null`/omitted = no per-transaction cap; negative → `400`.
  - When both are set, `per_tx_fee_cap_stroops` must be `<=` `daily_budget_stroops`, otherwise
    `400` naming both values. Either field may be left unset independently.
- `POST /v1/wallets/{id}/sponsor` — fee-bump a user's **already-signed** inner transaction.
  The gas tank signs only the outer fee-bump envelope; the inner transaction is passed through
  untouched. Over budget → `429`; duplicate inner tx → `409`.
- `GET  /v1/wallets/{id}/sponsored-transactions` — sponsorship history (paginated, filterable
  by status).

## Webhooks

- `POST   /v1/wallets/{id}/webhooks` — register an endpoint (URL + generated secret).
- `GET    /v1/wallets/{id}/webhooks` — list active endpoints.
- `DELETE /v1/wallets/{id}/webhooks/{endpoint_id}` — deactivate (soft delete, so the delivery
  history survives as an audit trail).
- `GET    /v1/wallets/{id}/webhooks/{endpoint_id}/deliveries` — delivery history (`?limit=`,
  default 50, max 200).

Deliveries are signed `HMAC-SHA256` over the raw body. Endpoint URLs are SSRF-screened:
loopback, private and link-local targets are rejected, IPv4 and bracketed IPv6 alike.

## API keys

All three require a **dashboard JWT** and wallet ownership — an API key can never manage keys,
so it cannot escalate or revoke itself.

- `POST   /v1/wallets/{id}/api-key` — generate/regenerate (the plaintext key is shown **once**;
  only a SHA-256 hash is stored).
- `GET    /v1/wallets/{id}/api-key` — metadata (prefix, created_at) — never the key itself.
- `DELETE /v1/wallets/{id}/api-key` — revoke.

## Audit logs

- `GET /v1/audit-logs` — your account's activity, filterable by `category` and a free-text
  `search`.

## Conventions

- **Pagination:** list endpoints take `?limit=` (default 50, max 200) and `?before=<uuid>` for
  keyset pagination. They return `{ "data": [...], "next_cursor": <uuid|null> }` — note this
  sits *inside* the response envelope, so the full shape is
  `{ statusCode, message, data: { data: [...], next_cursor } }`.
- **Amounts** are integer **stroops** (1 XLM = 10,000,000) end-to-end — never floats.
- **Errors** map to `400` (validation), `401`, `403`, `404`, `409` (conflict), `410` (removed
  custodial endpoints), `413` (body over 64 KiB), `429` (budget exceeded), `504` (upstream
  Horizon exceeded a route timeout). There is no `422`.
